DR.LSH - Data Reduction based on Locality Sensitive Hashing. DR.LSH is a fast instance selection method. Training classifiers, especially Support Vector Machines (SVM) on huge datasets is usually slow due to their high time complexities. 
DR.LSH alleviates this problem by quickly identifying and removing similar samples to a given sample according to a pre-defined similarity threshold.

The remarkable features of the proposed algorithm are:
• Simplicity
• Linear time complexity
• Integer-based calculations
• Satisfactorily preserving the extent of known classes
• Easy control of the preservation rate by adjusting the input parameters.
